      Reads from the cache event journal in batches. You may specify the start sequence,
      the minimum required number of items in the response, the maximum number of items
      in the response, a predicate that the events should pass and a projection to
      apply to the events in the journal.
      If the event journal currently contains less events than {@code minSize}, the
      call will wait until it has sufficient items.
      The predicate, filter and projection may be {@code null} in which case all elements are returned
      and no projection is applied.
