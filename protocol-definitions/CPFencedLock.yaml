     Acquires the given FencedLock on the given CP group. If the lock is
     acquired, a valid fencing token (positive number) is returned. If not
     acquired because of max reentrant entry limit, the call returns -1.
     If the lock is held by some other endpoint when this method is called,
     the caller thread is blocked until the lock is released. If the session
     is closed between reentrant acquires, the call fails with
     {@code LockOwnershipLostException}.

     Attempts to acquire the given FencedLock on the given CP group.
     If the lock is acquired, a valid fencing token (positive number) is
     returned. If not acquired either because of max reentrant entry limit or
     the lock is not free during the timeout duration, the call returns -1.
     If the lock is held by some other endpoint when this method is called,
     the caller thread is blocked until the lock is released or the timeout
     duration passes. If the session is closed between reentrant acquires,
     the call fails with {@code LockOwnershipLostException}.

     Unlocks the given FencedLock on the given CP group. If the lock is

     If the session is closed while holding the lock, the call fails with
     {@code LockOwnershipLostException}. Returns true if the lock is still
     held by the caller after a successful unlock() call, false otherwise.
