      Acquires the lock for the specified key for the specified lease time. After the lease time, the lock will be
      released. If the lock is not available, then the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling
      purposes and lies dormant until the lock has been acquired. Scope of the lock is for this map only. The acquired
      lock is only for the key in this map.Locks are re-entrant, so if the key is locked N times, then it should be
      unlocked N times before another thread can acquire it.
