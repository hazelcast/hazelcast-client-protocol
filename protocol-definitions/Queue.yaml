  - name: remainingCapacity

      Returns the number of additional elements that this queue can ideally (in
      the absence of memory or resource

      constraints) accept without blocking, or Integer.MAX_VALUE if there is no intrinsic limit. Note that you cannot

      always tell if an attempt to insert an element will succeed by inspecting remainingCapacity because it may be

      the case that another thread is about to insert or remove an element.
