      Acquires the given FencedLock on the given CP group. If the lock is
      acquired, a valid fencing token (positive number) is returned. If not
      acquired because of max reentrant entry limit, the call returns -1.
      If the lock is held by some other endpoint when this method is called,
      the caller thread is blocked until the lock is released. If the session
      is closed between reentrant acquires, the call fails with
      {@code LockOwnershipLostException}.

      Attempts to acquire the given FencedLock on the given CP group.
      If the lock is acquired, a valid fencing token (positive number) is
      returned. If not acquired either because of max reentrant entry limit or
      the lock is not free during the timeout duration, the call returns -1.
      If the lock is held by some other endpoint when this method is called,
      the caller thread is blocked until the lock is released or the timeout
      duration passes. If the session is closed between reentrant acquires,
      the call fails with {@code LockOwnershipLostException}.

      Unlocks the given FencedLock on the given CP group. If the lock is
      not acquired, the call fails with {@link IllegalMonitorStateException}.
      If the session is closed while holding the lock, the call fails with
      {@code LockOwnershipLostException}. Returns true if the lock is still
      held by the caller after a successful unlock() call, false otherwise.
