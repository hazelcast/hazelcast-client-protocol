  - name: statistics
    doc: |
      The statistics is a String that is composed of key=value pairs separated by ',' . The following characters
      ('=' '.' ',' '\') should be escaped in IMap and ICache names by the escape character ('\'). E.g. if the map name is
      MyMap.First, it will be escaped as: MyMap\.First

      The statistics key identify the category and name of the statistics. It is formatted as:
      mainCategory.subCategory.statisticName

      An e.g. Operating system committedVirtualMemorySize path would be: os.committedVirtualMemorySize

      Please note that if any client implementation can not provide the value for a statistics, the corresponding key, valaue
      pair will not be presented in the statistics string. Only the ones, that the client can provide will be added.

      The statistics key names can be one of the following (Used IMap named <StatIMapName> and ICache Named
      <StatICacheName> and assuming that the near cache is configured):

      clientType: The string that represents the client type. See {@link com.hazelcast.core.ClientType}

      clusterConnectionTimestamp: The time that the client connected to the cluster (milliseconds since epoch). It is reset on
      each reconnection.

      credentials.principal: The principal of the client if it exists. For
      {@link com.hazelcast.security.UsernamePasswordCredentials}, this is the username, for custom authentication it is set by
      the {@link com.hazelcast.security.Credentials} implementer.

      clientAddress: The address of the client. It is formatted as "<IP>:<port>"

      clientName: The name of the client instance. See ClientConfig.setInstanceName.

      enterprise: "true" if the client is an enterprise client, "false" otherwise.

      lastStatisticsCollectionTime: The time stamp (milliseconds since epoch) when the latest update for the statistics is
      collected.

      Near cache statistics (see {@link com.hazelcast.monitor.NearCacheStats}):

      nc.<StatIMapName>.creationTime: The creation time (milliseconds since epoch) of this Near Cache on the client.

      nc.<StatIMapName>.evictions: The number of evictions of Near Cache entries owned by this client.

      nc.<StatIMapName>.expirations: The number of TTL and max-idle expirations of Near Cache entries owned by the client.

      nc.<StatIMapName>.hits: The number of hits (reads) of Near Cache entries owned by the client.

      nc.<StatIMapName>.lastPersistenceDuration: The duration in milliseconds of the last Near Cache key persistence
      (when the pre-load feature is enabled).

      nc.<StatIMapName>.lastPersistenceFailure: The failure reason of the last Near Cache persistence (when the pre-load
      feature is enabled).

      nc.<StatIMapName>.lastPersistenceKeyCount: The number of Near Cache key persistences (when the pre-load feature is
      enabled).

      nc.<StatIMapName>.lastPersistenceTime: The timestamp (milliseconds since epoch) of the last Near Cache key
      persistence (when the pre-load feature is enabled).

      nc.<StatIMapName>.lastPersistenceWrittenBytes: The written number of bytes of the last Near Cache key persistence
      (when the pre-load feature is enabled).

      nc.<StatIMapName>.misses: The number of misses of Near Cache entries owned by the client.

      nc.<StatIMapName>.ownedEntryCount: the number of Near Cache entries owned by the client.

      nc.<StatIMapName>.ownedEntryMemoryCost: Memory cost (number of bytes) of Near Cache entries owned by the client.

      nc.hz/<StatICacheName>.creationTime: The creation time of this Near Cache on the client.

      nc.hz/<StatICacheName>.evictions: The number of evictions of Near Cache entries owned by the client.

      nc.hz/<StatICacheName>.expirations: The number of TTL and max-idle expirations of Near Cache entries owned by the
      client.

      nc.hz/<StatICacheName>.hits
      nc.hz/<StatICacheName>.lastPersistenceDuration
      nc.hz/<StatICacheName>.lastPersistenceFailure
      nc.hz/<StatICacheName>.lastPersistenceKeyCount
      nc.hz/<StatICacheName>.lastPersistenceTime
      nc.hz/<StatICacheName>.lastPersistenceWrittenBytes
      nc.hz/<StatICacheName>.misses
      nc.hz/<StatICacheName>.ownedEntryCount
      nc.hz/<StatICacheName>.ownedEntryMemoryCost

      Operating System Statistics (see {@link com.hazelcast.internal.metrics.metricsets.OperatingSystemMetricSet},
      {@link sun.management.OperatingSystemImpl}) and {@link com.sun.management.UnixOperatingSystemMXBean}:

      os.committedVirtualMemorySize: The amount of virtual memory that is guaranteed to be available to the running process in
      bytes, or -1 if this operation is not supported.

      os.freePhysicalMemorySize: The amount of free physical memory in bytes.

      os.freeSwapSpaceSize: The amount of free swap space in bytes.

      os.maxFileDescriptorCount: The maximum number of file descriptors.

      os.openFileDescriptorCount: The number of open file descriptors.

      os.processCpuTime: The CPU time used by the process in nanoseconds.

      os.systemLoadAverage: The system load average for the last minute. (See
      {@link java.lang.management.OperatingSystemMXBean#getSystemLoadAverage})
      The system load average is the sum of the number of runnable entities
      queued to the {@link java.lang.management.OperatingSystemMXBean#getAvailableProcessors} available processors
      and the number of runnable entities running on the available processors
      averaged over a period of time.
      The way in which the load average is calculated is operating system
      specific but is typically a damped time-dependent average.
      <p>
      If the load average is not available, a negative value is returned.
      <p>

      os.totalPhysicalMemorySize: The total amount of physical memory in bytes.

      os.totalSwapSpaceSize: The total amount of swap space in bytes.

      Runtime statistics (See {@link Runtime}:

      runtime.availableProcessors: The number of processors available to the process.

      runtime.freeMemory: an approximation to the total amount of memory currently available for future allocated objects,
      measured in bytes.

      runtime.maxMemory: The maximum amount of memory that the process will  attempt to use, measured in bytes

      runtime.totalMemory: The total amount of memory currently available for current and future objects, measured in bytes.

      runtime.uptime: The uptime of the process in milliseconds.

      runtime.usedMemory: The difference of total memory and used memory in bytes.

      userExecutor.queueSize: The number of waiting tasks in the client user executor (See ClientExecutionService#getUserExecutor)

      Not: Please observe that the name for the ICache appears to be the hazelcast instance name "hz" followed by "/" and
      followed by the cache name provided which is StatICacheName.
