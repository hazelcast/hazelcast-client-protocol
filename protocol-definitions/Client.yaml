      following characters ('=' '.' ',' '\') should be escaped.

      Please note that if any client implementation can not provide the value for statistics, the corresponding key, value
      pair will not be presented in the statistics string. Only the ones, that the client can provide will be added.

      The third parameter, metrics is a compressed byte array containing all metrics recorded by the client.

      The used compression algorithm is the same that is used inside the IMDG clients and members for storing the metrics blob
      in-memory. The algorithm uses a dictionary based delta compression further deflated by using ZLIB compression.

      The byte array has the following layout:

      +---------------------------------+--------------------+
      | Compressor version              |   2 bytes (short)  |
      +---------------------------------+--------------------+
      | Size of dictionary blob         |   4 bytes (int)    |
      +---------------------------------+--------------------+
      | ZLIB compressed dictionary blob |   variable size    |
      +---------------------------------+--------------------+
      | Number of metrics in the blob   |   4 bytes (int)    |
      +---------------------------------+--------------------+
      | ZLIB compressed metrics blob    |   variable size    |
      +---------------------------------+--------------------+

      ==========
      THE HEADER
      ==========

      Compressor version:      the version currently in use is 1.
      Size of dictionary blob: the size of the ZLIB compressed blob as it is constructed as follows.

      ===================
      THE DICTIONARY BLOB
      ===================

      The dictionary is built from the string fields of the metric and assigns an int dictionary id to every string in the metrics
      in the blob. The dictionary is serialized to the dictionary blob sorted by the strings using the following layout.

      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | Number of dictionary entries                   |   4 bytes (int)    |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | Dictionary id                                  |   4 bytes (int)    |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | Number of chars shared with previous entry     |   1 unsigned byte  |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | Number of chars not shared with previous entry |   1 unsigned byte  |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | The different characters                       |   variable size    |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | Dictionary id                                  |   4 bytes (int)    |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | ...                                            |   ...              |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+

      Let's say we have the following dictionary:
        - <42,"gc.minorCount">
        - <43,"gc.minorTime">

      It is then serialized as follows:
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | 2 (size of the dictionary)                     |   4 bytes (int)    |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | 42                                             |   4 bytes (int)    |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | 0                                              |   1 unsigned byte  |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | 13                                             |   1 unsigned byte  |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | "gc.minorCount"                                |   13 bytes         |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | 43                                             |   4 bytes (int)    |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | 8                                              |   1 unsigned byte  |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | 4                                              |   1 unsigned byte  |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | "Time"                                         |   13 bytes         |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+

      The dictionary blob constructed this way is then gets ZLIB compressed.

      ===============
      THE METRIC BLOB
      ===============

      The compressed dictionary blob is followed by the number of metrics
      (int) present in the metrics blob.

      The number of metrics is followed by the compressed metrics blob with
      the following layout:

      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | Metrics mask                                   |   1 byte           |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | (*) Dictionary id of prefix                    |   4 bytes (int)    |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | (*) Dictionary id of metric                    |   4 bytes (int)    |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | (*) Dictionary id of discriminator             |   4 bytes (int)    |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | (*) Dictionary id of discriminatorValue        |   4 bytes (int)    |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | (*) Enum ordinal of the unit                   |   1 byte           |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | (*) Excluded targets bitset                    |   1 byte           |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | (*) Number of tags                             |   1 unsigned byte  |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | (**) Dictionary id of the tag 1                |   4 bytes (int)    |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | (**) Dictionary id of the value of tag 1       |   4 bytes (int)    |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | (**) Dictionary id of the tag 2                |   4 bytes (int)    |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | (**) Dictionary id of the value of tag 2       |   4 bytes (int)    |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | ...                                            |   ...              |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | Metrics mask                                   |   1 byte           |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | (*) Dictionary id of prefix                    |   4 bytes (int)    |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+
      | ...                                            |   ...              |
      +------------------------------------------------+--------------------+

      The metrics mask shows which fields are the same in the current and the
      previous metric. The following masks are used to construct the metrics
      mask.

      MASK_PREFIX              = 0b00000001;
      MASK_METRIC              = 0b00000010;
      MASK_DISCRIMINATOR       = 0b00000100;
      MASK_DISCRIMINATOR_VALUE = 0b00001000;
      MASK_UNIT                = 0b00010000;
      MASK_EXCLUDED_TARGETS    = 0b00100000;
      MASK_TAG_COUNT           = 0b01000000;

      If a bit representing a field is set, the given field marked above with (*)
      is not written to blob and the last value for that field should be taken
      during deserialization.

      Since the number of tags are not limited, all tags and their values
      marked with (**) are written even if the tag set is the same as in the
      previous metric.

      The metrics blob constructed this way is then gets ZLIB compressed.
