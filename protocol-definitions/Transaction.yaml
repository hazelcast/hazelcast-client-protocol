            Identifies the type of the transaction. Possible values are:
            1 (Two phase):  The two phase commit is more than the classic two phase commit (if you want a regular
            two phase commit, use local). Before it commits, it copies the commit-log to other members, so in
            case of member failure, another member can complete the commit.
            2 (Local): Unlike the name suggests, local is a two phase commit. So first all cohorts are asked
            to prepare if everyone agrees then all cohorts are asked to commit. The problem happens when during
            the commit phase one or more members crash, that the system could be left in an inconsistent state.
