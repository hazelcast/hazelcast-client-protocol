  - name: sub
    doc: |
      Returns a view of the portion of this list between the specified from, inclusive, and to, exclusive.(If from and
      to are equal, the returned list is empty.) The returned list is backed by this list, so non-structural changes in
      the returned list are reflected in this list, and vice-versa. The returned list supports all of the optional list
      operations supported by this list.
      This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of the sort that commonly exist for arrays).
      Any operation that expects a list can be used as a range operation by passing a subList view instead of a whole list.
      Similar idioms may be constructed for indexOf and lastIndexOf, and all of the algorithms in the Collections class
      can be applied to a subList.
      The semantics of the list returned by this method become undefined if the backing list (i.e., this list) is
      structurally modified in any way other than via the returned list.(Structural modifications are those that change
      the size of this list, or otherwise perturb it in such a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results.)

      specified index minus one.
