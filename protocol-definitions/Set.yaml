    doc: |
      Adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present (optional operation).
      If this set already contains the element, the call leaves the set unchanged and returns false.In combination with
      the restriction on constructors, this ensures that sets never contain duplicate elements.
      The stipulation above does not imply that sets must accept all elements; sets may refuse to add any particular
      element, including null, and throw an exception, as described in the specification for Collection
      Individual set implementations should clearly document any restrictions on the elements that they may contain.

      Removes the specified element from this set if it is present (optional operation).

    doc: |
      Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this set if they're not already present
      (optional operation). If the specified collection is also a set, the addAll operation effectively modifies this
      set so that its value is the union of the two sets. The behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified
      collection is modified while the operation is in progress.

      Removes from this set all of its elements that are contained in the specified collection (optional operation).

      Retains only the elements in this set that are contained in the specified collection (optional operation).
      In other words, removes from this set all of its elements that are not contained in the specified collection.
      If the specified collection is also a set, this operation effectively modifies this set so that its value is the
      intersection of the two sets.
