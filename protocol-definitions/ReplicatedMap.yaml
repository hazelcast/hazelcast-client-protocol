      Associates a given value to the specified key and replicates it to the cluster. If there is an old value, it will
      be replaced by the specified one and returned from the call. In addition, you have to specify a ttl and its TimeUnit
      to define when the value is outdated and thus should be removed from the replicated map.

      Copies all of the mappings from the specified map to this map (optional operation). The effect of this call is
      equivalent to that of calling put(Object,Object) put(k, v) on this map once for each mapping from key k to value
      v in the specified map. The behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified map is modified while the
      operation is in progress.

      The clear operation wipes data out of the replicated maps.It is the only synchronous remote operation in this
      implementation, so be aware that this might be a slow operation. If some node fails on executing the operation,
      it is retried for at most 3 times (on the failing nodes only). If it does not work after the third time, this
      method throws a OPERATION_TIMEOUT back to the caller.

      Returns a lazy Set view of the key contained in this map. A LazySet is optimized for querying speed
      (preventing eager deserialization and hashing on HashSet insertion) and does NOT provide all operations.
      Any kind of mutating function will throw an UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION. Same is true for operations
      like java.util.Set#contains(Object) and java.util.Set#containsAll(java.util.Collection) which would result in
      very poor performance if called repeatedly (for example, in a loop). If the use case is different from querying
      the data, please copy the resulting set into a new java.util.HashSet.
