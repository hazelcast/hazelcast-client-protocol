- name: acquire
  doc: |
     Acquires the given number of permits if they are available, and returns immediately, reducing the number of
     available permits by the given amount. If insufficient permits are available then the current thread becomes
     disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of three things happens: some other thread
     invokes one of the methods for this semaphore, the current thread is next to be assigned permits and the number
     of available permits satisfies this request, this ISemaphore instance is destroyed, or some other thread
     the current thread. If the current thread has its interrupted status set on entry to this method, or is  while
     waiting for a permit, then  is thrown and the current thread's interrupted status is cleared.

     Releases the given number of permits, increasing the number of available permits by that amount. There is no
     requirement that a thread that releases a permit must have acquired that permit by calling one of the
     acquire()acquire methods. Correct usage of a semaphore is established by programming convention in the application.
