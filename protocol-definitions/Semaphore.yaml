      Acquires the given number of permits if they are available, and returns immediately, reducing the number of
      available permits by the given amount. If insufficient permits are available then the current thread becomes
      disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of three things happens: some other thread
      invokes one of the methods for this semaphore, the current thread is next to be assigned permits and the number
      of available permits satisfies this request, this ISemaphore instance is destroyed, or some other thread
      the current thread. If the current thread has its interrupted status set on entry to this method, or is  while
      waiting for a permit, then  is thrown and the current thread's interrupted status is cleared.

    doc: |
      Releases the given number of permits, increasing the number of available permits by that amount. There is no
      requirement that a thread that releases a permit must have acquired that permit by calling one of the
      acquire()acquire methods. Correct usage of a semaphore is established by programming convention in the application.

      reducing the number of available permits by the given amount. If insufficient permits are available then this
      method will return immediately with the value false and the number of available permits is unchanged.
