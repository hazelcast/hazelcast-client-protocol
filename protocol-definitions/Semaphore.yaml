  - name: acquire
    doc: >
      Acquires the given number of permits if they are available, and returns
      immediately, reducing the number of

      available permits by the given amount. If insufficient permits are available then the current thread becomes

      disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of three things happens: some other thread

      invokes one of the methods for this semaphore, the current thread is next to be assigned permits and the number

      of available permits satisfies this request, this ISemaphore instance is destroyed, or some other thread

      the current thread. If the current thread has its interrupted status set on entry to this method, or is  while

      waiting for a permit, then  is thrown and the current thread's interrupted status is cleared.
