      Causes the current thread to wait until it is signalled or Thread#interrupt interrupted. The lock associated with
      this Condition is atomically released and the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes and
      lies dormant until one of four things happens:
      Some other thread invokes the #signal method for this Condition and the current thread happens to be chosen as the
      thread to be awakened; or Some other thread invokes the #signalAll method for this Condition; or Some other thread
      Thread#interrupt interrupts the current thread, and interruption of thread suspension is supported; or A spurious wakeup occurs.
      In all cases, before this method can return the current thread must re-acquire the lock associated with this condition.
      When the thread returns it is guaranteed to hold this lock. If the current thread: has its interrupted status set
      on entry to this method; or is Thread#interrupt interrupted while waiting and interruption of thread suspension
      is supported, then INTERRUPTED is thrown and the current thread's interrupted status is cleared. It is
      not specified, in the first case, whether or not the test for interruption occurs before the lock is released.
      The current thread is assumed to hold the lock associated with this Condition when this method is called.
      It is up to the implementation to determine if this is the case and if not, how to respond. Typically, an exception will be
      thrown (such as ILLEGAL_MONITOR_STATE) and the implementation must document that fact.
      An implementation can favor responding to an interrupt over normal method return in response to a signal. In that
      case the implementation must ensure that the signal is redirected to another waiting thread, if there is one.

      If any threads are waiting on this condition then one is selected for waking up.That thread must then re-acquire
      the lock before returning from await. An implementation may (and typically does) require that the
      current thread hold the lock associated with this Condition when this method is called. Implementations must
      document this precondition and any actions taken if the lock is not held. Typically, an exception such as
      ILLEGAL_MONITOR_STATE will be thrown.
