      Query operation to retrieve the current value of the PNCounter.
      <p>
      The invocation will return the replica timestamps (vector clock) which
      can then be sent with the next invocation to keep session consistency
      guarantees.
      The target replica is determined by the {@code targetReplica} parameter.
      If smart routing is disabled, the actual member processing the client
      message may act as a proxy.
