      Sets the count to the given value if the current count is zero.
      If the count is not zero, then this method does nothing

  - name: await
    doc: |
      Causes the current thread to wait until the latch has counted down
      to zero, or an exception is thrown, or the specified waiting time
      elapses. If the current count is zero then this method returns
      immediately with the value true. If the current count is greater than
      zero, then the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling
      purposes and lies dormant until one of five things happen: the count
      reaches zero due to invocations of the {@code countDown} method, this
      ICountDownLatch instance is destroyed, the countdown owner becomes
      disconnected, some other thread Thread#interrupt interrupts the current
      thread, or the specified waiting time elapses. If the count reaches zero
      then the method returns with the value true. If the current thread has
      its interrupted status set on entry to this method, or is interrupted
      while waiting, then {@code InterruptedException} is thrown
      and the current thread's interrupted status is cleared. If the specified
      waiting time elapses then the value false is returned.  If the time is
      less than or equal to zero, the method will not wait at all.

      Decrements the count of the latch, releasing all waiting threads if

      re-enabled for thread scheduling purposes, and Countdown owner is set to
      null. If the current count equals zero, then nothing happens.
