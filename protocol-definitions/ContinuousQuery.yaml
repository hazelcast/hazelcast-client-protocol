    name: setReadCursor
    since: 2.0
    doc: |
      This method can be used to recover from a possible event loss situation.
      This method tries to make consistent the data in this `QueryCache` with the data in the underlying `IMap`
      by replaying the events after last consistently received ones. As a result of this replaying logic, same event may
      appear more than once to the `QueryCache` listeners.
      This method returns `false` if the event is not in the buffer of event publisher side. That means recovery is not
      possible.
