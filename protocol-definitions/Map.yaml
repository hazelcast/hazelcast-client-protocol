  doc: |
     Puts an entry into this map with a given ttl (time to live) value.Entry will expire and get evicted after the ttl
     If ttl is 0, then the entry lives forever.This method returns a clone of the previous value, not the original
     (identically equal) value previously put into the map.Time resolution for TTL is seconds. The given TTL value is
     rounded to the next closest second value.

     Removes the mapping for a key from this map if it is present (optional operation).
     Returns the value to which this map previously associated the key, or null if the map contained no mapping for the key.
     If this map permits null values, then a return value of null does not necessarily indicate that the map contained no mapping for the key; it's also
     possible that the map explicitly mapped the key to null. The map will not contain a mapping for the specified key once the
     call returns.

- name: delete
  doc: |
     Removes the mapping for a key from this map if it is present.Unlike remove(Object), this operation does not return
     the removed value, which avoids the serialization cost of the returned value.If the removed value will not be used,
     a delete operation is preferred over a remove operation for better performance. The map will not contain a mapping
     for the specified key once the call returns.
     This method breaks the contract of EntryListener. When an entry is removed by delete(), it fires an EntryEvent
     with a null oldValue. Also, a listener with predicates will have null values, so only keys can be queried via predicates

     Puts an entry into this map with a given ttl (time to live) value.Entry will expire and get evicted after the ttl
     If ttl is 0, then the entry lives forever. Similar to the put operation except that set doesn't
     return the old value, which is more efficient.

     Adds an index to this map for the specified entries so that queries can run faster.If you are querying your values

     Index attribute should either have a getter method or be public.You should also make sure to add the indexes before
     adding entries to this map.
     Indexing time is executed in parallel on each partition by operation threads. The Map is not blocked during this
     operation.The time taken in proportional to the size of the Map and the number Members.
     Until the index finishes being created, any searches for the attribute will use a full Map scan, thus avoiding
     using a partially built index and returning incorrect results.

     Similar to the put operation except that set doesn't return the old value, which is more efficient.
