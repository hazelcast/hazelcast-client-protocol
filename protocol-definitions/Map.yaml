      Puts an entry into this map with a given ttl (time to live) value.Entry will expire and get evicted after the ttl
      If ttl is 0, then the entry lives forever.This method returns a clone of the previous value, not the original
      (identically equal) value previously put into the map.Time resolution for TTL is seconds. The given TTL value is
      rounded to the next closest second value.

      If this map permits null values, then a return value of null does not necessarily indicate that the map contained no mapping for the key; it's also
      possible that the map explicitly mapped the key to null. The map will not contain a mapping for the specified key once the

    doc: |
      Removes the mapping for a key from this map if it is present.Unlike remove(Object), this operation does not return
      the removed value, which avoids the serialization cost of the returned value.If the removed value will not be used,
      a delete operation is preferred over a remove operation for better performance. The map will not contain a mapping
      for the specified key once the call returns.
      This method breaks the contract of EntryListener. When an entry is removed by delete(), it fires an EntryEvent
      with a null oldValue. Also, a listener with predicates will have null values, so only keys can be queried via predicates
