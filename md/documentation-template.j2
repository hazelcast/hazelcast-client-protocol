{# START of manually written sections #}
## 1. Introduction
This document explains the new binary protocol that Hazelcast uses to communicate with the clients.
This document is not a guide to implement a client that will interact with Hazelcast; rather, it specifies the wire
data format for the messages exchanged between a client and a Hazelcast member node. Any client that wants to
communicate with the Hazelcast cluster should obey the data format and communication details explained in this document.

The protocol is designed to be strict enough to ensure standardization in the communication, but flexible enough
that developers may expand upon the protocol to implement custom features.

General guidelines:
- This document uses the terms MUST, MUST NOT, MAY, SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT as described in the [IETF RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
- Client refers to the entity which communicates with a Hazelcast member node.
- Member or server refers to the Hazelcast node to which the client connects.

## 2. Data Format Details
Hazelcast provides a communication interface to access distributed objects through client protocol. This interface is
a TCP socket listening for request messages. Currently, TCP socket communication is the only way a client can connect to
a member. The client MUST connect to the port that Hazelcast member is listening to for new connections. Because of
this, there is no fixed port to which the client must connect.

Protocol communication is built on sending and receiving messages. Client protocol defines a simple entity called
client message for communication. It is the only data format defined by this protocol.

### 2.1. Client Message
A client message is a transmission data unit composed of frames which are array of bytes. Its main purpose is to
encapsulate a unit of data to be transferred from one entity the another. It may represent a request, a response, or an
event response. A client message can be fragmented into multiple client messages and sent in order one-by-one. See the
[Client Message Fragmentation](#214-client-message-fragmentation) section for details.

#### 2.1.1. Frame
As said above, frames are building blocks of a client message. A frame is an array of bytes consisted of frame length,
flags and payload bytes as shown below.

| Frame Length | Flags | Payload |
| ------------ | ----  | ------- |
| int32 | uint16 | Payload bytes |

Frame length includes the length of itself, flags, and payload bytes. Hence, the minimum size of a frame is `6` bytes in
case of an empty payload (`4` bytes for frame length and `2` bytes for flags). Payload bytes store the actual
data carried over the frame. Frames must be in the little-endian order.

Flag bits have the structure shown below.

| Flag Bit | Name | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| 15 | BEGIN_FRAGMENT_FLAG | Used in message fragmentation |
| 14 | END_FRAGMENT_FLAG | Used in message fragmentation |
| 13 | IS_FINAL_FLAG | Set to 1 if the frame is the last frame of a client message |
| 12 | BEGIN_DATA_STRUCTURE_FLAG | Set to 1 if the frame is the begin frame of a custom type or list or map of variable sized type(s) |
| 11 | END_DATA_STRUCTURE_FLAG | Set to 1 if the frame is the end frame of a custom type or list or map of variable sized type(s) |
| 10 | IS_NULL_FLAG | Set to 1 if the frame represents a null payload |
| 9 | IS_EVENT_FLAG | Set to 1 if the frame is the initial frame of a client message that represents a event response from a member |
| 8 | BACKUP_AWARE_FLAG | Set to 1 if the client enabled receiving backup acks directly from members that backups are applied to |
| 7 | BACKUP_EVENT_FLAG | Set to 1 if the frame is the initial frame of a client message that represents a backup event response from a member |
| 6 to 0 | Reserved | Reserved for future usage |

#### 2.1.2. Initial Frame
Each client message starts with a special frame called the initial frame. It is special in the sense that it includes all the
fix sized parameters of a client message. Fix sized parameters are parameters of a request, a response, or an event response
message in which the sizes of the parameter in bytes can be known in advance. These types of parameters are listed below.

| Type | Size in bytes |
| ---- | ------------- |
| byte (int8 or uint8) | 1 |
| boolean | 1 |
| int (int32 or uint32) | 4 |
| long (int64 or uint64) | 8 |
| float | 4 |
| double | 8 |
| UUID* | 17 |

> *: UUID is described by two longs. Since UUID can be null, a boolean flag is also used to distinguish null UUIDs from non-null ones. That makes the length 17 bytes (1 + 8 + 8) in total.

The overall structure of the initial frame is shown below.

For requests and event responses, the overall structure of the initial frame is shown below.

| Frame length | Flags | Message type | Correlation ID | Partition ID | Fix sized parameter 1 | Fix sized parameter 2 | ... | Fix sized parameter n |
| ------------ | ----- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------ | --------------------- | --------------------- | --- | --------------------- |
| int32 | uint16 | int32 | int64 | int32 | Parameter 1 bytes | Parameter 2 bytes | ... | Parameter n bytes |

For responses, the overall structure of the initial frame is shown below.

| Frame length | Flags | Message type | Correlation ID | Backup Acks Count | Fix sized parameter 1 | Fix sized parameter 2 | ... | Fix sized parameter n |
| ------------ | ----- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --- | --------------------- |
| int32 | uint16 | int32 | int64 | uint8 | Parameter 1 bytes | Parameter 2 bytes | ... | Parameter n bytes |

Unfragmented client messages must have their `BEGIN_FRAGMENT_FLAG` and `END_FRAGMENT_FLAG` bits set to `1` in
their initial frames.

For the details of frame length and flags, see the section [above](#211-frame).

Payload bytes of the initial frame consists of message type, correlation ID, partition ID, or the backup acks count
depending on the message type and fix sized parameters.

##### 2.1.2.1. Message Type
Message type corresponds to a unique operation of a distributed object such as `Map.Put` request, `List.Get` response or
an event response for a registered listener.

| Message type byte | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| 0 | Unused, set to 0 |
| 1 | Service ID |
| 2 | Method ID |
| 3 | Request, response or event response ID |

Service ID represents the unique ID assigned to managed services provided by Hazelcast such as `Map`, `List`,
`Client` etc. It is in the range of `0` to `255`.

Method ID represents the unique IDs of methods provided by the service. It is in the range of `1` to `255`.

The last bit of the message type represents whether this client message is a request, a response, or an event response.
It is equal to `0` for requests, `1` for responses, and `2` plus event ID for event responses.

For example:
- `0x00010200` is the message type for the request (`00`) for the `Get` method (`02`) of the `Map` service (`01`).
- `0x00050F01` is the message type for the response (`01`) for the `Get` method (`0F`) of the `List` service (`05`).
- `0x00011C02` is the message type for the event response (`02`) for the `AddEntryListener` method (`1C`) of the `Map` service (`01`).

For the error messages that are sent by the member node to the client, the message type is set to `0x00000000`.

A full list of message types can be found in the [Protocol Messages](#{{ protocol_message_offset }}-protocol-messages) section.

If the Hazelcast member receives a message with an unsupported message type, it will return the `UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION`
error to the client with the message type of `0x00000000`. The client is guaranteed to receive only the messages listed
in the [Protocol Messages](#{{ protocol_message_offset }}-protocol-messages) and the error messages.

The details of the different message types are described in the next sections.

##### 2.1.2.1.1. Request Message Type
Each distributed object defines various operations. Each operation corresponds to a well-defined request message to
be sent to the cluster. For each request message, the client will get a response message from the cluster. Request messages
MUST be sent from the client to the server.

The request parameters are binary encoded entirely within the payload bytes of the frames that constitute the client message.

##### 2.1.2.1.2. Response Message Type
Once a request is received and processed on the member side, the member produces a response message and sends it to
the client. Each request message type defines a response message that can be sent. The correlation ID relates all instances
of the response messages to their requests.

The response parameters are binary encoded entirely within the payload bytes of the frames that constitute the client messages.

##### 2.1.2.1.3. Event Response Message Type
An event response message is a special kind of response message. A client can register to a specific listener by
sending a request message with the message type of adding a listener. When an event is triggered that the client is
listening for, the member will send a message to the client using the same correlation ID as the original request message.
The payload bytes of the frames of the event message carries the specific event object. The possible event message types
for a registration request are documented in the `Event Message` section of each request in the
[Protocol Messages](#{{ protocol_message_offset }}-protocol-messages) section.

For these messages, `IS_EVENT_FLAG` bit of the initial frame of the client message is set to `1`.

The member will continue to send the client event updates until the client unregisters from that event or the connection
is broken.

##### 2.1.2.1.4. Error Message Type
The member may return an error response to the client for the request it made. For this message, the message type is set
to `0x00000000`. The payload of the member's response message contains the error message along with the error code.
You may choose to provide the error codes directly to the user or you may use some other technique, such as exceptions,
to delegate the error to the user. See the `ErrorHolder` custom type and the list of [Error Codes](#58-error-codes) for details.

##### 2.1.2.2. Correlation ID
This ID correlates the request to responses. It should be unique to identify one message in the communication. This ID
is used to track the request-response cycle of a client operation. Members send response messages with the same ID as
the request message. The uniqueness is per connection. If the client receives the response to a request and the request
is not a multi-response request (i.e. not a request for event transmission), then the correlation ID for the request can
be reused by the subsequent requests. Note that once a correlation ID is used to register for an event, it SHOULD NOT
be used again unless the client unregisters (stops listening) for that event.

##### 2.1.2.3. Partition ID
The partition ID defines the partition against which the operation is executed. This information tells the
client which member handles which partition. The client can use this information to send requests to the responsible
member directly for processing. The client gets this information from the `PartitionsView` event of the
`AddClusterViewListener` request. (see the [Protocol Messages](#{{ protocol_message_offset }}-protocol-messages))

To determine the partition ID of an operation, the client needs to compute the Murmur Hash (version 3, 32-bit, see
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash) and
[https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/wiki/MurmurHash3](https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/wiki/MurmurHash3)) of a
certain byte-array (which is identified for each message in the description section) and take the modulus of the result
over the total number of partitions. The seed for the Murmur Hash SHOULD be `0x0100193`. Most operations with a key
parameter use the key parameter byte-array as the data for the hash calculation.

Some operations are not required to be executed on a specific partition but can be run on a global execution pool. For
these operations, the partition ID is set to a negative value. No hash calculation is required in this case.

##### 2.1.2.4 Backup Acks Count
When the client performs an operation on a distributed object that requires backups to be created when a change is made,
the client only receives the response of the operation when acks from the member nodes that participated in the
backup process are seen.

Hazelcast offers two different ways to perform operations that involve backups.

If the client is a [smart client](#61-smart-client-and-unisocket-client), it can mark the requests it sends as backup
aware by setting the `BACKUP_AWARE_FLAG` to `1`. When a Hazelcast member receives such a request, it sends a response
message that carries information about how many backup operations must be performed along with the actual response in
this part of the initial frame. In this case, the client is notified about the successful backups with event responses
coming from the member nodes that created the backups in their partitions. To do so, the client must register listeners to
all member nodes that it is connected to using the `LocalBackupListener` message. The client SHOULD wait until it
receives event responses marked with `BACKUP_EVENT_FLAG` from that many Hazelcast member nodes before resolving the
response of the request.

However, if the client is a [unisocket client](#61-smart-client-and-unisocket-client) or the requests going out from
it are not marked with the `BACKUP_AWARE_FLAG`, the member node that receives the request from the client only sends
the response back when it receives acks from other cluster members which are participated in the backup process.

The former way is faster in the sense that it results in fewer serial network hops.

#### 2.1.3. Encoding of Variable Sized Parameters

The parameters of the client message that have variable size, that are not listed in the fix sized types described
in the [Initial Frame](#212-initial-frame) section, such as string, list of primitive or custom types, etc. are
encoded following the initial frame in their respective frames. A variable sized parameter can be encoded into one or more
frames based on its type. For the sections below, the following special frames will be used while describing the encoding
process of the variable sized parameters.

- `NULL_FRAME`: A frame that has `1` in its `IS_NULL_FLAG` bit. It is used to represent parameters that have null values.
It has empty payload.
- `BEGIN_FRAME`: A frame that has `1` in its `BEGIN_DATA_STRUCTURE_FLAG` bit. It is used to mark the beginning of the
parameter encodings that cannot fit into a single frame. It has empty payload bytes.
- `END_FRAME`: A frame that has `1` in its `END_DATA_STRUCTURE_FLAG` bit. It is used to mark the ending of the parameter
encodings that cannot fit into a single frame. It has empty payload bytes.

For the encodings described below, if the parameter is of a variable sized type and its value is null, it is encoded as
`NULL_FRAME`.

##### 2.1.3.1. Encoding of String Parameters
Each string parameter of the client message can be encoded into its own single frame. String parameters are expected to
be encoded according to UTF-8 standard described in the [RFC 3629](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629). Encoded string data must be placed in the payload
bytes of the frame. Below is the sample structure of a string frame.

| Frame length | Flags | UTF-8 encoded string data |
| ------------ | ----- | ------------------------- |
| int32 | uint16 | UTF-8 encoded string bytes |

##### 2.1.3.2. Encoding of Custom Type Parameters
Custom types, which are the parameters of the client messages that consist of other fix or variable sized parameters
are encoded in between `BEGIN_FRAME` and `END_FRAME`. Overall, the structure of custom type encodings is shown below.

| `BEGIN_FRAME` | Payload Frame 1 | Payload Frame 2 | ... | Payload Frame n | `END_FRAME` |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --- | --------------- | ----------- |

`BEGIN_FRAME` and `END_FRAME` are used to identify the boundaries of different custom type encodings. While reading
frames of a client message, when a `BEGIN_FRAME` is encountered, it means that the custom type encoding is started and
it is safe to read frames until the `END_FRAME` is encountered. All of the frames in between those two will carry the
actual data stored inside the custom type.

Payload frames follow a similar schema to the initial frame and variable sized data frame structure described above. All
of the fix sized parameters of the custom object are encoded in the initial payload frame that comes after the `BEGIN_FRAME`
and all the other variable sized or custom parameters are encoded in the following payload frames in the same way
described in the [Encoding of Variable Sized Parameters](#213-encoding-of-variable-sized-parameters) section. Therefore,
each custom type encoding consists of at least three and possibly more frames depending on the types of the parameters
of the custom object.

For example, if the custom type has the parameters of integer, long, string, and another custom type that has
boolean and string parameters, then the encoded structure of the custom object will be as below.

| Frame | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `BEGIN_FRAME` | `BEGIN_FRAME` of the custom type |
| Payload frame for the fix sized parameters | Payload frame for the integer and long parameters |
| Payload frame for the var sized parameter | Payload frame for the string parameter |
| `BEGIN_FRAME` | `BEGIN_FRAME` of the custom type parameter |
| Payload frame for the fix sized parameter | Payload frame for the boolean parameter of the custom type parameter |
| Payload frame for the var sized parameter | Payload frame for the string parameter of the custom type parameter |
| `END_FRAME` | `END_FRAME` for the custom type parameter |
| `END_FRAME` | `END_FRAME` for the custom type |

As depicted above, fix sized parameters of the custom type which are integer and long parameters, are encoded in the initial
frame that follows the `BEGIN_FRAME` of the custom type. Then, the payload frame for the string parameter comes. It is encoded
in the same way described in the [Encoding of String Parameters](#2131-encoding-of-string-parameters) section.
Custom types can also contain other custom type parameters. They are encoded in the same way as described at the
beginning of the section. Payload frames of the inner custom type, which are the frames for the boolean parameter and the
string parameter, are encoded in between its respective `BEGIN_FRAME` and `END_FRAME`. Finally, the `END_FRAME` at the
end signals the finish of the custom type encoding.

##### 2.1.3.3. Encoding of List Parameters

Client messages may also contain a list of fix sized or variable sized types. The encoding of the list frames changes
according to the type of the list elements.

##### 2.1.3.3.1. Encoding of List of Fix Sized Parameters

Since the byte size of the fix sized parameters and the element count of the list can be known in advance, the content
of the list can be fit into a single frame. For these types of lists, payload size is calculated as
`ELEMENT_COUNT * ELEMENT_SIZE_IN_BYTES` and elements are encoded at the offsets depending on their indexes on lists.
Assuming zero-based indexing, element offsets can be calculated as `ELEMENT_INDEX * ELEMENT_SIZE_IN_BYTES`.

For example, a list of integers can be encoded into a single frame as follows:

| Frame length | Flags | int-0 | int-1 | ... | int-n |
| ------------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | --- | ----- |
| int32 | uint16 | int32 | int32 | ... | int32 |

Due to member-side technical restrictions, writing the elements of a list into a single frame puts an upper limit on
the maximum number of elements that the list contains. The number of elements that can be fit into a single frame can
be calculated as `(2^31 - 6) / ELEMENT_SIZE_IN_BYTES`. For example, for int64, a maximum of `268435455` (around `268` million)
entries per list is supported by the protocol.

##### 2.1.3.3.2. Encoding of List of Variable Sized Parameters
Lists of variable sized parameters, just like [custom type parameters](#2132-encoding-of-custom-type-parameters), are encoded in
between `BEGIN_FRAME` and `END_FRAME`. Each element of the list is encoded in their respective frames consecutively
following the `BEGIN_FRAME`. Depending on the type of list elements, each element may be encoded into one or more
frames. In fact, the encoding of a list of variable sized parameters is very similar to the encoding of the custom types.

For example, a list of string objects can be encoded as follows:

| `BEGIN_FRAME` | string-0 | string-1 | ... | string-n | `END_FRAME` |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | --- | -------- | ----------- |
| Begin frame of the list | Frame containing UTF-8 encoded bytes of string-0 | Frame containing UTF-8 encoded bytes of string-1 | ... | Frame containing UTF-8 encoded bytes of string-n | End frame of the list |

Note that, elements of the list must be of the same type.

##### 2.1.3.4. Encoding of Map Parameters
Map parameters can be encoded in different ways depending on the types of keys and values.

If both are fix sized parameters as described above, map entries can be encoded into a single frame since the size of a
map entry can be known in advance. For these map entries, the payload size of the frame can be calculated as
`ENTRY_COUNT * (SIZE_OF_THE_KEY + SIZE_OF_THE_VALUE)`. Map entries are encoded in the offset positions depending on
their iteration order. The offset of the keys and values can be calculated as `ENTRY_INDEX * (SIZE_OF_THE_KEY + SIZE_OF_THE_VALUE)`
and `ENTRY_INDEX * (SIZE_OF_THE_KEY + SIZE_OF_THE_VALUE) + SIZE_OF_THE_KEY` respectively, assuming zero-based indexing.

For example, map entries of int32 to int64 mappings can be encoded as below.

| Frame length | Flags | int32-0 | int64-0 | int32-1 | int64-1 | ... | int32-n | int64-n |
| ------------ | ----- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --- | ------- | ------- |
| int32 | uint16 | int32 | int64 | int32 | int64 | ... | int32 | int64 |

If one of them is fix sized and the other is variable sized, map entries are encoded in between
`BEGIN_FRAME` and `END_FRAME`. Each key or value of the entry set that is variable sized is encoded in its respective
frames consecutively following the `BEGIN_FRAME`. As described above, this encoding may result in one or more frames
depending on the type of the variable sized key or value. Each key or value of the entry set that is fix sized is
encoded into a single frame as described in the [Encoding of List of Fix Sized Parameters](#21331-encoding-of-list-of-fix-sized-parameters) section.

For example, a map of string to int32 can be encoded as below.

| `BEGIN_FRAME` | string-0 | string-1 | ... | string-n | list of int32s | `END_FRAME` |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- | --- | -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Begin frame of the map entries | Frame containing UTF-8 encoded bytes of string-0 (key-0) | Frame containing UTF-8 encoded bytes of string-1 (key-1) | ... | Frame containing UTF-8 encoded bytes of string-n (key-n) | Frame containing list of int32s (values) | End frame of the map entries |

However, if both of them are variable sized, map entries are encoded in between `BEGIN_FRAME` and `END_FRAME`.
Each key or value of the entry set is encoded in its respective frames consecutively following the `BEGIN_FRAME`.

For example, a map of string to list of int32s can be encoded as below.

| `BEGIN_FRAME` | string-0 | list of int32-0 | string-1 | list of int32-1 | ... | string-n | list of int32-n | `END_FRAME` |
| ------------- | -------- | ---------------- | -------- | --------------- | --- | -------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| Begin frame of the map entries | Frame containing UTF-8 encoded bytes of string-0 (key-0) | Frame containing list of int32-0 (value-0) | Frame containing UTF-8 encoded bytes of string-1 (key-1) | Frame containing list of int32-1 (value-1) | ... | Frame containing UTF-8 encoded bytes of string-n (key-n) | Frame containing list of int32-n (value-n) | End frame of the map entries |

### 2.1.4. Client Message Fragmentation
A fragment is a part of a client message where the client message is too large and it is split into multiple client messages.
It is used to interleave large client messages so that small but urgent client messages can be sent without waiting for the transmission
of the large client message.

Fragmentation is handled through `BEGIN_FRAGMENT_FLAG` and `END_FRAGMENT_FLAG` bits of the frame flags.
Unfragmented messages have `1` in both flag bits. For fragmented client messages, the first fragment has `1` in
`BEGIN_FRAGMENT_FLAG` and `0` in `END_FRAGMENT_FLAG`, the last fragment has `0` in `BEGIN_FRAGMENT_FLAG` and `1` in
`END_FRAGMENT_FLAG` and middle fragments have `0` in both of the flag bits.

Fragments of different client messages are identified by the int64 fragment IDs. Fragment ID is encoded into the payload bytes.

Initial frames of the fragmented client messages have the following structure.

**First Fragment Initial Frame**

| Frame length | Flags | Payload |
| ------------ | ----- | ------- |
| Frame length | BEGIN_FRAGMENT_FLAG = 1, END_FRAGMENT_FLAG = 0 | Fragment ID |
| int32 | uint16 | int64 |

**Middle Fragment Initial Frame**

| Frame length | Flags | Payload |
| ------------ | ----- | ------- |
| Frame length | BEGIN_FRAGMENT_FLAG = 0, END_FRAGMENT_FLAG = 0 | Fragment ID |
| int32 | uint16 | int64 |

**Last Fragment Initial Frame**

| Frame length | Flags | Payload |
| ------------ | ----- | ------- |
| Frame length | BEGIN_FRAGMENT_FLAG = 0, END_FRAGMENT_FLAG = 1 | Fragment ID |
| int32 | uint16 | int64 |

Then, visual representation of the possible fragments of a client message with N frames can be as below:

**First Fragment**

| First Fragment Initial Frame | client message - 1st frame | client message - 2nd frame | ... | client message - ith frame |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- | --- | -------------------------- |

**Middle Fragments**

| Middle Fragment Initial Frame | client message - (i+1)th frame | client message - (i+2)th frame | ... | client message - jth frame |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | --- | -------------------------- |

**Last Fragment**

| Last Fragment Initial Frame | client message - (j+1)th frame | client message - (j+2)th frame | ... | client message - nth frame |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | --- | -------------------------- |

### 2.1.5. Client Message Boundaries
As described in the [Initial Frame](#212-initial-frame) and [Client Message Fragmentation](#214-client-message-fragmentation) sections,
the initial frame of the client messages can be identified with the `BEGIN_FRAGMENT_FLAG` and `END_FRAGMENT_FLAG` bits.

The last frame of a client message can be identified by checking the `IS_FINAL_FLAG` bit. If set to `1`, it signals that the client
message is ended.

### 2.1.6. Backward Compatibility of the Client Messages
Hazelcast Open Binary Protocol guarantees backward compatibility for all major 2.x versions. Therefore, developments done in the
protocol MUST NOT result in deletion of services, methods, or any parameters. However, new services, methods, or parameters MAY be added.

For the addition of fix sized parameters to service methods, additional parameters can be detected by checking the
frame length of the initial frame. An old reader reads and uses old parameters and simply skips the bytes that contain
the additional parameters.

On the other hand, the addition of variable sized parameters can be detected using the `END_FRAME`. An old reader reads
and uses old frames and simply skips the additional frames until it detects the `END_FRAME`.

### 2.1.7. Augmented Backus–Naur Format Representation of the Client Messages

## 4. Connection Guide

### 4.1. Opening a Connection
TCP socket communication is used for client-to-member communication. Each member has a socket listening for incoming connections.

As the first step of client-to-member communication, the client MUST open a TCP socket connection to the member.

A client needs to establish a single connection to each member node if it is a smart client. If it is a unisocket client,
a single connection is enough for a particular client. For details, see [Smart Client versus Unisocket Client](#61-smart-client-and-unisocket-client).

### 4.2. Connection Initialization
After successfully connecting to the member TCP socket, the client MUST send three bytes of initialization data to identify
the connection type to the member.

For any client, the three byte initializer data is [`0x43`, `0x50`, `0x32`], which is the string `CP2` in UTF-8 encoding.

### 4.3. Authentication
The first message sent through an initialized connection must be an authentication message. Any other type of message
will fail with an authorization error unless the authentication is complete.

Upon successful authentication, the client will receive a response from the member with the member's IP address, UUID
that uniquely identifies the member, and cluster UUID along with the other response parameters described
in `Client.Authentication` message. The status parameter in the authentication response should be checked for the
authentication status.

There are four possible statuses:

- `0`: Authentication is successful.
- `1`: Credentials failed. The provided credentials (e.g. cluster name, username, or password) are incorrect.
- `2`: Serialization version mismatch. The requested serialization version and the serialization version used at the member side
are different. The client gets the member's serialization version from the `serverHazelcastVersion` parameter of the response.
It is suggested that the client tries to reconnect using the matching serialization version assuming that the client
implements the version for serialization.
- `3`: The client is not allowed in the cluster. It might be the case that client is blacklisted from the cluster.

There are two types of authentications:

- Username/Password authentication: `Client.Authentication` message is used for this authentication type which contains
username and password for the client (if present) along with the cluster name.
- Custom credentials authentication: `Client.CustomAuthentication` message is used for this authentication type. Custom
authentication credentials are sent as a byte-array.

### 4.4. Communication

After successful authentication, a client may send request messages to the member to access distributed objects
or perform other operations on the cluster. This step is the actual communication step.

Once connected, a client can do the followings:
1. Send periodic updates.
2. Get updates on cluster state view which consists of partition table and member list.
3. Send operation messages and receive responses.

All request messages will be sent to the member and all responses and event responses will be sent to the client.

See [Protocol Messages](#{{ protocol_message_offset }}-protocol-messages) for details.

### 4.5. Closing Connections
To end the communication, the network socket that was opened should be closed. This will
result in releasing resources on the member side specific to this connection.

## 5. Requests and Responses
### 5.1. Distributed Objects
To access distributed object information, use the `GetDistributedObject` message.

To add a listener for adding distributed objects, use the `AddDistributedObjectListener` message.

To remove a formerly added listener, use the `RemoveDistributedObjectListener` message.

### 5.2. Operation Messages And Responses
Operational messages are the messages where a client can expect exactly one response for a given request. The client
knows which request the response correlates to via the correlation ID. An example of one of these operations is a
`Map.Put` operation.

To execute a particular operation, set the message type ID to the corresponding operation type and encode the parameters
as described in the [Client Message](#21-client-message) section.

### 5.3. Proxies
Before using a distributed object, the client SHOULD first create a proxy for the object. Do this by using the `CreateProxy`
request message.

To destroy a proxy, use the `DestroyProxy` request message.

#### 5.3.1. Proxy Creation

**Java Example:**
```java
HazelcastInstance client = HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient();
IMap map = client.getMap("map-name");
```

**Python Example**
```python
client = HazelcastClient()
map = client.get_map("map-name")
```
Raw bytes for the create proxy request and response are shown below.

**Client Request**
```
// Initial frame
0x16 0x00 0x00 0x00 // Frame length
0x00 0xc0 // Flags
0x00 0x04 0x00 0x00 // Message type
0x30 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 // Correlation ID

0x00 0x00 // Flags
0x6d 0x61 0x70 0x2d 0x6e 0x61 0x6d 0x65 // UTF-8 encoded data of the "map-name" string
// Frame for the name of the map service (which is "hz:impl:mapService")

0x00 0x20 // Flags
0x68 0x7a 0x3a 0x69 0x6d 0x70 0x6c 0x3a 0x6d 0x61 0x70 0x53 0x65 0x72 0x76 0x69 0x63 0x65 // UTF-8 encoded data of the "hz:impl:mapService" string
```

**Member Response**
```
// Initial frame
0x13 0x00 0x00 0x00 // Frame length
0x00 0xe0 // Flags
0x01 0x04 0x00 0x00 // Message type
0x30 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 // Correlation ID
0x00 // Backup acks count
```

For a request with a key, the client SHOULD send the request to the cluster member that houses the data for the key.
A client can do this by using the partition ID. For the `CreateProxy` request above, since the proxy creation is meant
to be sent to a random cluster member, partition ID is given as `-1`.

The response to a request message is always one of the following:
- Regular response message: The response is the message as listed in the protocol specification for the specific request message type.
- An error message: See the [Error Codes](#58-error-codes) section.

We give examples of operations on various data structures below.

#### 5.3.2. List Example

**Java Example**
```java
IList myList = client.getList("list"); // Create proxy
System.out.println(myList.get(3));
```

```python
my_list = client.get_list("list") # Create proxy
print(my_list.get(3))
```

### 5.4. Multiple Responses to a Single Request
The client can listen for updates on a member or when specific actions are taken on the cluster. This is managed by the event listener mechanism.
The event messages have the `IS_EVENT_FLAG` bit is set in the initial frame and they use the same correlation ID as used in the original
registration request for all the subsequent event update messages. The registration message and possible event messages sent are
described in the `Event Message` section of the message descriptions.

### 5.5. Listeners
Listeners are mean to communicate multiple responses to a client. The client uses one of the listener registration messages to listen
for updates at the cluster. Listeners are specific to a data structure. For example, there is specific listener for map entries and queue
items. To see how these listeners are explicitly encoded, see the relevant message in the
[Protocol Messages](#{{ protocol_message_offset }}-protocol-messages) section.

Because the same correlation ID is reused for every event response for a given request, the correlation ID MUST NOT be
reused from the event requests unless the client unregisters the listener.

One can send `RemoveListener` request message specific to the registration request to remove the listener that the client has
registered to.

### 5.6. Cluster View Listener
Cluster view consists of views of partition and member lists. The client gets the updates of these views as event responses
after registering a cluster view listener to one of the members of the cluster.

The partition list view tells the client which members handle which partition ID. The client can use this information
to send the related requests to the responsible member (for the request key if it exists) directly for processing.

The event response for the partition list view consists of the member-partition ownership information.

The other part of the cluster view is the member list view. This view is the list of members connected to the cluster. With this
information and the previous member list that the client has, member updates on the cluster such as member addition or removal
can be seen. This information is needed especially if the client operates as a smart client.

### 5.7. Timeouts and Retry
It is recommended that the client should be able to handle situations where the member may not be able to return the response
in an expected time interval. Even if the response to a specific message is not received, the user may or may not retry the
request. If the client retries the request, they SHOULD NOT use the same correlation ID.

If no message has been sent in the member's heartbeat time, the member will automatically disconnect from the client. To prevent
this from occurring, a client SHOULD submit a `Ping` request to the member periodically. A ping message is only sent from the
client to the member; the member does not perform any ping request.

### 5.8. Error Codes
The list of errors along with the error code and description is provided below. Note that there may be error messages with
an error code that is not listed in the table. The client can handle this situation differently based on the particular
implementation. (e.g. throw an unknown error code exception)

## 6. Miscellaneous

### 6.1. Smart Client and Unisocket Client
The client can work as a smart or as a unisocket client. In both cases, a client SHOULD calculate which partition ID
is responsible for the requests and put this information in the partition ID offset of the initial frame.

- **Smart Client:** A smart client sends the request directly to the cluster member that is responsible for the related key.
In order to do so, the client determines the address of the cluster member that handles the calculated partition ID.
The request message will be sent on this cluster member connection.

- **Unisocket Client:** The client sends the request to any cluster member that it is connected to, regardless of the key 
for the request. The cluster member will in turn redirect the request to the correct member in the cluster that handles
the request for the provided key.

The biggest difference between the two types of clients is that a smart client must be connected to all of the members and
must constantly update its partition tables so it knows which connection to use to submit a request. Both clients are compliant
with the protocol defined in this document.

### 6.2. Serialization
While mostly an implementation detail, serialization plays a crucial role in the protocol. In order for a client to execute
an operation on the member that involves data structure, such as putting some entry in a map or queue, the client must
be aware of how objects are serialized and deserialized so that the client can process the bytes it receives accordingly.
The member and client should use the same serialization versions in order to communicate. The version is negotiated in the
connection authentication phase. In general, one needs to use serialization to serialize byte-array type parameters in the messages as specified
in the [Protocol Messages](#{{ protocol_message_offset }}-protocol-messages) section. The following are examples of such objects that must be serialized
before being sent over the wire:

- Key
- Value
- Old value
- New value
- Callable (Executor Service)
- IFunction (Atomics)
- EntryProcessor (JCache)
- ExpiryPolicy (JCache)
- CacheConfig (JCache)
- ListenerConfig (JCache)
- Interceptor (Map)

A client may follow Hazelcast's native serialization or it may implement its own custom serialization solution. For more
information on how Hazelcast serializes its objects, see the official [Reference Manual](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#serialization) serialization section.

For all byte-array parameters, the API users should implement the following, depending on the operation type:
- If the operation is such that no member side deserialization is needed for the parameter, then the user can just use
any serialization and there is no need for implementation on the member side.
- If the operation processing at the member requires deserialization of the byte-array parameter, then the user should
use a Java object implementing one of the Hazelcast serializations and may need to do some member side implementations
depending on the chosen serialization type. Furthermore, the serializer must be registered in the serialization configuration
of the member as described in the serialization section of the [Reference Manual](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#serialization).

The client authentication request message contains the serialization version parameter. The client and the member decide the serialization
version to be used using this information. Hazelcast serialization versions will be matched to provide a compatible serialization.
There are two cases that can occur:
- The client may have a higher serialization version than the member. In that case, the client will auto configure
itself during authentication to match the member serialization version.
- The client may have a lower serialization version than the member. In that case, the member should be configured with
the system property to downgrade the member serialization version.

### 6.3. Security
Most of the security is configured on the member side in a Hazelcast cluster. A client must authenticate itself, which in turn
lets the member establish an endpoint for the client. The member can restrict what a client can and cannot access. The current protocol
does not provide explicit support for encryption. For more information, see the [Security](https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#security) chapter of the Hazelcast Reference Manual.
